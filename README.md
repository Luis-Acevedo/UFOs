# UFOs Sightings
Module 11 Challenge

# Are Aliens Among Us
Based on data we have gathered create a web page for fellow ufologists to visit and look at sightings data. Based on the data we have been given we want to be able to know what each kind of sighting was. With a little discription people will be able to think "Are they out there?"

# Probing our data

- When you first access the website we have our brief open message and at the bottom you can see the filter search. The website starts with the database populated so the user has something to look at.

- As you type in your information your search narrows. There is placeholder text in each filter that is a guide to the format that needs to be entered. For this picture we simply entered fl in the state filter and were returned with only the results from Florida. 

# Technological Advancments from Exploring
One draw back from the site is that we only have sighitng data from 2010. It would be more useful if we had a comprehensive database of sightings spanning a few years. Because we can only see limited data it is harder to discern a pattern. I would recommend adding plotly as well to the website to make dynamic graphs out of the information present from the tables. As well as adding a function where people can submit sightings. This way we can start to create our own database and not have to deal with the challenges of finding and potentially paying for a dataset.
